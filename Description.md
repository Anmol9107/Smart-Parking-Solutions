Abstract
With the increase in vehicle production and world population, more and more parking
spaces and facilities are required. In world context, many approaches were suggested and
implemented based on sensor technology, image processing and character recognition
technology. Most of the parking areas today in India currently operate without or with a small
computerized system using a small database. They usually require vehicle owners to roam
around and manually check the occupancy of individual spots. The problem is usually
encountered in metropolitan, where number of vehicles is higher as compared to the number of
parking spaces available. Implementing proposed system will help to resolve the problem of
finding a parking spot in a huge parking lot, the time wasted in finding the spot and help provide
better public service. It will improve visitor’s experience, increase parking utilization and
prevent unnecessary capital investments.
The owners are concerned that they are not maximizing profit due the inefficient
managements of parking slots. This project aims to examine the development of smart parking
solution using image processing to detect the vacant spaces in the parking lot. In the system,
CCTV cameras will be deployed in the parking lot, which detects and monitors the occupation of
the parking lot. Features of this system include vacant parking space detection, display of
available parking spaces and different types of parking spaces namely vacant and occupied.
The solution consists of a Graphic User Interface which shows the status of vacant and
filled parking spots in the parking lot. The research has been conducted through quantitative and
qualitative methodology within an overall inductive framework through observing the problem.
The feasibility of the proposed model has been analyzed through financial, technical and
operational perspectives and it will be discovered that digital image processing technology based
solution has the possibility to rationalize the vehicle parking management system. Software used
is Matlab.
